## **Plan Breakdown**

### 1. **Basic Setup:**
   - Set up the **Electron** app with initial folder structure and configurations.
   - Install required dependencies for **React**, **SQLite**, **GraphQL**, and other necessary libraries.
   - Set up **sidebar navigation** (with Settings included in the sidebar) and the basic layout.

### 2. **Core Functionality (Basic Features):**
   - Set up the **GraphQL server** for managing app data (SQLite as the database).
   - Set up basic **state management** using **Context API**.
   - **Basic slideout error notification** system, with error messages that can automatically slide out or remain visible if needed.
   - Implement **basic navigation** as part of the core functionality in the sidebar.
   
### 3. **Feature Implementation (in order)**:
   - **Regex Tester**: Implement regex testing functionality (this will include building the Regex-related logic and adding tests).
     - Write tests for regex validation, real-time pattern generation, and error handling.
   - **JSON Formatter**: Implement the JSON formatting functionality (including validation and text editor features).
     - Write tests for JSON validation and formatting.
   - **Snippet Manager**: Implement snippet storage, search, and syntax highlighting.
     - Write tests for snippet functionality (storage, search, and retrieval).

### 4. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Polish the UI with subtle animations/tweaks.
   - Test and refine the error handling system (slideout notifications and component highlighting).

### 5. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Continue developing **unit tests** for each module as they are built.
   - Perform integration and end-to-end tests for the app as a whole.
   - Refine the user experience based on feedback and any discovered issues.
